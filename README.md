# OpenCV_High_Resolution_Colorization
This section documents the strategy for coloring high-resolution black-and-white Mars
imagery using low-resolution color data. The approach combines high-performance
geospatial libraries (Rasterio) with computer vision libraries (OpenCV, scikit-image) to
handle alignment, color separation, and filtering. The core idea is to use the L*a*b* color
space to separate luminance (detail) from chrominance (color) and apply histogram
matching for color consistency.
